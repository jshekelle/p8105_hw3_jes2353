## Problem 1

Data Import

```{r}
data("brfss_smart2010")
```


Data Cleaning:
* format the data to use appropriate variable names;
* focus on the “Overall Health” topic
* include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor”
* organize responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Excellent” to “Poor”

```{r}
brfss_smart2010 = 
  brfss_smart2010 %>% 
   janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") 

 

```
